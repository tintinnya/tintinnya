**tintinnya/tintinnya** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:
-->

- 🔭 I’m currently working on trying to keep my coffee mug full while juggling side projects and “serious” work.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to adult responsibly, and maybe a little bit of new tech on the side.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on anything fun, weird, or that makes me say: “Wait… this might actually work!”
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with figuring out why my plants keep dying despite me following all the TikTok plant tips.
- 💬 Ask me about random trivia, questionable life hacks, or which snacks pair best with coding.
- 📫 How to reach me: shout really loud, or just find me on X.
- 😄 Pronouns: human / caffeinated entity
- ⚡ Fun fact: I once convinced myself that organizing my folders counts as “deep work.”
